Discrete Distributions:

"""""""""""""""Uniform Distribution use:"""""""""""""""

The uniform distribution characterizes data over an interval uniformly, with a as the smallest value and b as the largest value.


"""""""""""""""Binomial Distribution use:"""""""""""""""

The binomial distribution is used to represent the number of events that occurs within n independent trials.


"""""""""""""""Negative Binomial Distribution use:"""""""""""""""

If the random variable X is the number of trials necessary to produce r events that each have probability p, then the probability mass function (PMF) of X is given by: the hypergeometric1 definition.

If the random variable Y is the number of nonevents that occur before you observe the r events, which each have probability p, then the probability mass function (PMF) of Y is given by: the hypergeometric2 definition.


"""""""""""""""Geometric Distribution use:"""""""""""""""

If the random variable X is the total number of trials necessary to produce one event with probability p, then the probability mass function (PMF) of X is given by: the geometric1 definition.

If the random variable Y is the number of nonevents that occur before the first event (with probability p) is observed, then the probability mass function (PMF) of Y is given by: the geometric2 definition.


"""""""""""""""Hypergeometric Distribution use:"""""""""""""""

The hypergeometric distribution is used for samples drawn from small populations, without replacement. 
For example, you have a shipment of N televisions, where N1 are good (successes) and N2 are defective (failure). If you sample n televisions of N at random, without replacement, you can find the probability that exactly x of the n televisions are good.

"""""""""""""""Poisson Distribution use:"""""""""""""""

The Poisson distribution is a discrete distribution that models the number of events based on a constant rate of occurrence. The Poisson distribution can be used as an approximation to the binomial when the number of independent trials is large and the probability of success is small.
