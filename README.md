# Probability_Distributions_Calc

Discrete Distributions:

"""""""""""""""Uniform Distribution use:"""""""""""""""
The uniform distribution characterizes data over an interval uniformly, with a as the smallest value and b as the largest value.



"""""""""""""""Binomial Distribution use:"""""""""""""""
The binomial distribution is used to represent the number of events that occurs within n independent trials.



"""""""""""""""Geometric Distribution use:"""""""""""""""
If the random variable X is the total number of trials necessary to produce one event with probability p, then the probability mass function (PMF) of X is given by: the geometric1 definition.

If the random variable Y is the number of nonevents that occur before the first event (with probability p) is observed, then the probability mass function (PMF) of Y is given by: the geometric2 definition.



"""""""""""""""Hypergeometric Distribution use:"""""""""""""""
The hypergeometric distribution is used for samples drawn from small populations, without replacement. 
For example, you have a shipment of N televisions, where N1 are good (successes) and N2 are defective (failure). If you sample n televisions of N at random, without replacement, you can find the probability that exactly x of the n televisions are good.
